### About

In this graduate seminar we will explore the nature of speech perception explanations for why sound systems look the way they do and why certain phonological phenomena are more common than others. Since at least the 19th century linguists have concerned with the speaker-hearer relationship and the force it exerts on the directions of sound change (e.g., Baudoin de Courtenay, Paul Passy). We will build on this tradition by examining more recent developments in theoretical approaches to what is called *phonetically based phonology*. Our readings will establish an intellectual history of this line of thinking, covering a variety of theoretical positions (e.g., Lindblom's *H & H* theory, Ohala's theory of misperception, Kingston & Diehl's notion of *phonetic knowledge*, and Blevins' *Evolutionary Phonology* among others) that each propose well-defined, though not necessarily compatible, roles for speech production and perception in patterns of sounds. We will quickly engage with experimental evidence supporting these theoretical positions. Our task will be to examine (critique/support) each of these studies with an eye towards experimental technique, phonological history (and to some extent synchrony), and the predictions implied by the authors' conclusions. Some issues we will consider are whether phonetic factors in phonology are teleological, whether the speakers' and listeners' contributions to the structure of sound systems are complementary or at odds with each other, and whether speaker "difficulties" and listener "mistakes" are as important in sound change as they're often claimed to be.
